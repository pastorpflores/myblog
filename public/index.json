And for deciding to spend a minute or two here. You’ve probably just arrived by chance and feel a bit unsure about what you’ve found. Don’t worry, let me explain where you are and who I am. I’m Pablo. A European energy engineer with a passion for gadgets, batteries, DIY projects, and technology in general. I’m amazed by the modern world in every sense—from the bottom level of technological implementation to the abstract concepts of current business models, markets, and strategic trends. I mean no harm; I just want to entertain you and, if possible, share some ideas.

I won’t lie, I’ve been there too—scrolling for hours without really retaining anything, spending mere seconds on each photo or video. At this stage in the refinement of the algorithm, blogs might seem like the lamest way of sharing content, but for this very reason, now is the time to advocate for a calmer, more reflective medium. I don’t promise I’ll succeed, but I’m going to try, and this is my small contribution. I enjoy spending hours digging through the internet to find geeky gems hidden in its corners. But 38% of webpages that existed in 2013 have disappeared today 1. That’s why I want to maintain my personal collection of solutions, tech content, and cool people I discover, and if I’m doing that… why not share it with you? I’ve been working for several years now, and there have been key moments and experiences that were quite profound and formative for my understanding of the technical world. If they can be even a fraction as transformative for you as they were for me, this site will have been worthwhile. Consider it a professional diary about the energy sector, technology, management, and strategic reflections to read when I’m old. And in the meantime, you can read it too. I enjoy creating beautiful infographics, graphs, and aesthetic content in general, so if you like to procrastinate as I do, I hope to provide you with some enjoyment.
